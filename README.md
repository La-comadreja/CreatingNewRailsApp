This script automates creating an empty Ruby on Rails application with postgresql and deploying it to Github.
It assumes the User has installed postgresql and logged into Github on their machine, and created an empty 
Github repository with the same name as the Rails application.

Instructions for how to use the script can be obtained by running the script without command line parameters.
